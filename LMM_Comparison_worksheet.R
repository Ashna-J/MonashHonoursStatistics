#### 1. Setup (You Try It) ####

## to start with, we will load a package for data management
## and load a package for fitting Linear Mixed effects Models (LMMs)

## recall that loading a package is like opening an app
## and you need to repeat this process each time you start up R
## if everything installed successfully already
## this code should work and return no errors
## if this does not work, try to install it first
## by uncommenting the install packages code

# install.packages("data.table", dependencies = TRUE)
# install.packages("lme4", dependencies = TRUE)
# install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE)
# install.packages("visreg", dependencies = TRUE)
library(data.table)
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)
library(visreg)

## load the data (note this is already an R dataset)
## so we use a new function readRDS()
## make sure that the data file is located in
## your project directory
d <- readRDS("aces_daily_sim_processed.RDS")

#### 2. Several Different Models ####
