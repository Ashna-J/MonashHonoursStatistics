# Install `R`

The first step for this unit is getting `R` installed and setup on
your computer. `R` is primarily a language. To have a nicer way to
interact with and use `R` we will use RStudio. RStudio is known as an
*I*ntegrated *D*evelopment *E*nvironment or IDE. It is a program that
helps to keep your code, output, graphs, and files all together in one
place.

## Windows OS

1.  Follow [this guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu)


## Mac OS

1.  Make sure that you are running a current (ideally latest) version
    of Mac OS (at time of writing: 10.14, Mojave). 

2.  Using the app store, install and open Xcode. If you need a guide,
    see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9m6HozVjo8)
	
3.  Follow [this guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu)


# Try `R`

To make sure that `R` and RStudio are installed and working correctly,
follow these steps:

1.  Find and open RStudio on your computer.  There should be four
    "windows".
	
2.  Go to the window named "Console" and click at the prompt. The
    prompt is just this symbol: ">".
	
3.  At the console prompt, type this code and then press "enter"/"return":

```r 

3 + 1

```

If everything worked, `R` should return the answer, 4.
