# PSY4210 Resources

This is an applied statistics and methods unit. It will introduce
methods both from a conceptual and applied perspective. The unit will
make use of `R`, a programming language and environment for
statistics.

`R` is different from other statistical software packages you may have
used in a few ways. Unlike SPSS, `R` is completely controlled by
written code. `R` also is open source, meaning that all of the code
used in `R` and in any analysis are publicly and freely viewable. This
is good for science as it means it is possible to verify any aspect of
`R`. `R` is available free of cost as it is written and maintained by
a community of thousands of developers. Because it is community
driven, instead of every feature coming with `R` by default. Most of
`R` features come through add on packages. You can think of these like
apps on a phone. `R` is the operating system (Android, iOS), but often
you may spend most your time using apps (in `R` lingo,
packages). Like apps, there are thousands of `R` packages, and this
extensive ecosystem makes `R` one of the most powerful and flexible
environment for statistics.

This unit does not assume any background in `R`. Over the semester,
you will learn some basics of `R` programming, but mostly, you will be
able to copy and paste existing code and just change the dataset and
variables to suit your specific analytic needs.

This GitHub repository has a number of resources for the unit.

1.  Week 1, we will start by just getting `R` installed, setup, and
    learning a few basics. Please see the page 
	[Intro to R](IntroR.md).
	
2.  Week 2, we will learn about linear mixed effects models (LMMs;
    Part 1). Please see the page [LMM Pt1](LMM_Pt1.md).

3.  Week 3, we will learn about linear mixed effects models (LMMs; Part 2). TBD

4.  Week 4, we will learn about interactions and moderation. TBD

5.  Week 5, we will learn about model selection and comparison. TBD

6.  Week 6, we will learn about generalized linear mixed effects
    models (GLMMs). TBD

7.  Week 7, we will learn about working with data. TBD

8.  Week 8, we will learn about merging and reshaping data. TBD

9.  Week 9, we will learn about data cleaning and repeated measures data. TBD

10.  Week 10, we will learn about multiple imputation for missing data. TBD

11.  Week 11, we will learn about graphs and data visualization (Part 1). TBD

12.  Week 12, we will learn about graphs and data visualization (Part 2). TBD
