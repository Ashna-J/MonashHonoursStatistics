# 1. Setup

Everything you need in `R` should already be setup. However, if you
want to check, the packages you need are below. The `library()`
commands should work, but if not you can try installing them again.

```r 

## general data management
install.packages("data.table", dependencies = TRUE) 

## mixed effects models
install.packages("lme4", dependencies = TRUE) 

## graphing
install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE) 

## load the packages (basically open/run the apps)
library(data.table)
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)

```

# 2. Lecture 02 Worksheet

For the second lecture, download these two files: 

- [LMM Part 1](LMM_Pt1_worksheet.R) and
- [R Diary Data](aces_daily_sim_processed.RDS)

to your laptop into the same project folder you made in Lecture 01.

# 3. Summary and Checklist

This module covers installing and setting up `R` and RStudio. You have
a functioning version of `R` on your own computer. Before the first
lecture, make sure you've done everything by going through this
checklist.

- [ ] You have completed the assignments in DataCamp
- [ ] You bring your laptop
- [ ] You have the worksheet and data downloaded, or can download them
  in Lecture 2.
